What is this?
====================================================================
This package is an over-engineered solution to a mostly non-existent problem,
as a sort of love letter to other needlessly complex programs like the 
"Enterprise Fizzbuzz" https://github.com/Mikkeren/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition .
 
The package gives the user the size (memory usage) of an in-core, dense 
matrix.  The output is an S4 class object that can be manipulated to be 
presented in different ways (different units, short/long versions of those 
units, etc.).  For more information, see the package vignette and the manual.
It's basically a fancy printing system for byte sizes.



How do I install it?
====================================================================
